## Cloud Fundamentals

### Introduction to Cloud Computing
- Definition and benefits of cloud computing
    A service that is available over the internet, allowing users to access computing resources on-demand.

### Types of Cloud Deployments
- Private Cloud: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization.
- Public Cloud: Cloud services offered over the public internet and available to anyone.
- Hybrid Cloud: A combination of private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Cloud Service Models
- Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
  - SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.

### Related Concepts
- Virtualization: The creation of a virtual version of something, such as a server or storage device.

- API: A set of protocols for building and interacting with software applications. Communication between different software intermediaries. Cloud and API are related as APIs enable interaction with Cloud services that are written by Cloud providers.
- Regions: Geographical areas where cloud providers have data centers.
- Availability Zones: Isolated locations within data center regions that provide redundancy and reliability.
- Scalability: The ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand.
- Elasticity: The ability to automatically adjust resources based on demand.
- High Availability: Ensuring that cloud services are consistently operational and accessible.
- Disaster Recovery: Strategies and processes for recovering data and applications in the event of a disaster.
- Agility: The ability to quickly adapt to changes and deploy new applications or services.
